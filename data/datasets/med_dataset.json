the\npsychological studies on perception and the modern physiology of\nvision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and\nto affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound and\nfunction in unison.\nevery cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it is\ntherefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain a\ncongruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through an\nexploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we are\nconfronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate\ndynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and\nspatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and often\ncomplex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, and\ntachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by such\nmethods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological\ndisturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of\nvisual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception of\nmovement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light and\ndarkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,\nat the same time, may be of determinant importance

glaucoma\nafter a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations on\nthe simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states on\nthe basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsias\noccasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can be\nestablished between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,\nhowever, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinal\ndetachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exact\nperimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser rate\nthan in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into consideration\nalso in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatous\npatient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visual\nfield defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, the\nsimultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether the\nbinasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of a\nglaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes an\nindependent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarified\nin the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebral\nvessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even if\nthis role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases of\nbinasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnostic\nand therapeutic measures are carried out.", "id": 361}, {"text": "1131.

promotes differentiation\nof large basophilic cells to small\nlymphocytes, resulting in an increased output of\nsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymph\nnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of large\npyroninophilic cells ('transitional\ncells') into immature and mature plasma cells.\nthe effects of thyroxin on dif-\nferentiation are followed by an increased growth\nof the thymo-lymphatic

nuclear membrane, and\nfine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-\nplasm into the cytoplasm where they may\nexpand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is not\nnecessarily intersected by membranous\nprofiles of special configuration, as is borne\nout by e. coli b and other gram-negative\norganisms.  when membranous profiles\nof special configuration are present, as\nin the gram-positive b. subtilis, these\ndo not appear differentiated into clearly\ndefinable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi\nsubstance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.\nas for kinetosomes, the

capacity.  however, upon application\nof the tetranitro-blue tetrazolium\ntechnic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.\nthey are presumably identical with\nbasal granules.  the membranous

morphologically,\neven in b. subtilis chondrioids differ\nfundamentally from the mitochondria in that\nthey are not built up from composite\nmembranes, they are extensions of the plasma\nmembrane, and they may not be completely\nclosed systems.  regarding this last\npoint, it was observed that chondrioids may\npossibly stand in open connection with\nthe cell's environment, since its lumen is not\nseparated from the cell wall by a\nplasma membrane.  although as yet nothing is\nknown about this, it does not seem to\nbe precluded that these membranous organelles\nmay function also as intracellular\ntransport systems.  contrary to porter's ideas\nabout er, the chondrioids are not\nextensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the\nplasma membrane.  on the other hand,\nthey are in the

calvaria serves\nnot only to protect the brain but also to\nanchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsic\nmuscles of the skull.  its form, particularly\nin thick-skulled mammals such as the pig,\nis determined more by the demands of these\nmuscles and of the scalp than by the form\nof the brain.\nthe principal function of the diploe\nis to form a lightweight yet rigid separation\nof the two

are increased by the deposition of\nbone in the suture margins.  the sutures,\nhowever, do not function as epiphyses and\nhave no innate growth potential: removal\nof a suture does not disturb final

ligament\nsuperiorly and the iliopectineal ligament medially.\ntreatment consists in bed rest, analgesics, and freshfrozen\nplasma during the acute phase.  during the convalescent\nphase, a hessing long brace is used to protect\nthe knee from hemarthrosis until functional return\nof the quadriceps femoris has occurred.  to date, the\nvalidity of the theory that the femoral-nerve palsy is\nthe result of iliopsoas hemorrhage at the musculotendinous\njunction and compression of the femoral nerve beneath\nthe inguinal ligament has not been verified.  the\nauthors anticipate some day seeing a non-hemophilic patient\nwith a traumatic iliacus hemorrhage and femoral\nneuropathy.  should such an opportunity present itself,\nexploration beneath poupart's ligament may show the\nfemoral nerve to be compressed and thus confirm the\nproposed cause of the clinical picture.", "id": 1032}, {"text": "hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia: a 5-year prospective study.\n   medicosocial studies of hemophilia are of\nparticular clinical importance in allowing an assessment\nof the likely course of the disease at different\nages and for differing grades of severity, and in\nproviding knowledge of which complications cause\nthe most disability, loss of education, and earning\ncapacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinical\nimpression of the disease which arises from the\nrecurrent admission of the same few severely affected\nhemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individual\nvariation in the number and severity of complications\nin different hemophiliacs an accurate individual\nprognosis can never be given.  in general,\nhowever, the number of spontaneous episodes per\nyear decreases with age, while the severity of individual\nepisodes tends to increase, at least until\nthe age of 21 yr.  there is general agreement that\nthe bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are due\nto hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathy\ninvolves the knee more than it does any other joint.\nthe increased time spent in hospital per episode in\nlater life is in part at least due to the development\nof relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due to\nhemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy.\nthus the correct management of individual\nhemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance,\nand at the present time too little is known\nof the best possible treatment for these episodes.\nlittle is known of the pathological mechanisms of\nhemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presence\nof blood or its presence under tension which\nleads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerning\nthe routine admission of all hemarthroses\nto hospital regardless of severity and also about the\nadvisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoid\nthe development of destructive arthropathy.  because\nof the individual variation between patients, the\nchanges in the pattern of the disease with age, and\nthe difficulty of obtaining suitable control patients\nthese questions can be answered only by further\nlongterm prospective medicosocial studies.", "id": 1033}]}
